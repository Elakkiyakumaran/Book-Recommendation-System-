# Book-Recommendation-System-

**Project Overview:**

This project leverages Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning to recommend books to users based on their input. Using content-based filtering and cosine similarity over intelligently engineered textual features (like authors, genres, page length, year, and more), the system suggests books similar to a given title. The solution includes a Flask-based interactive web interface for real-time book recommendations.

**Tools and Technologies:**

*VS code
*Python (pandas, numpy, sklearn, nltk)
*Machine Learning: Cosine Similarity, CountVectorizer
*Flask (for backend & serving recommendations)
*HTML/CSS (for attractive UI)
*Pickle (for saving precomputed model and data)

**Project Goal:**

To build a fast, scalable, and personalized book recommender system that helps users explore new books based on their preferences â€” improving the reading experience and aiding book discovery.

**Dataset**

The dataset has been taken from the kaggle for model training. The recommendation system has taken the input then analyze by the model train.
